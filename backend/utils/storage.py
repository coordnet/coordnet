"""
Custom storage classes for handling different access patterns to object storage.

This module provides two storage classes:
1. InternalS3Storage: For internal docker network access using the 'minio' hostname
2. BrowserS3Storage: For browser access via signed URLs using 'localhost:<port>'

Both classes inherit from django-storages S3Storage and point to the same bucket,
but with different endpoint configurations.
